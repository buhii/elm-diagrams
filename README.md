# elm-diagrams

An Elm library for creating diagrams, inspired by Brent Yorgey's [Diagrams](http://projects.haskell.org/diagrams/) library for Haskell.

Support for
- Layout: Position diagrams next to, above, and atop each other
- Picking: Given a diagram and a point, find what was clicked on
- Getting coordinates: Given a _tag path_, find what coordinates it was placed at in a diagram.

Under construction; many bugs and TODOs.
